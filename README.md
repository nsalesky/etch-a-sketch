# Etch-a-Sketch #

**Description**
---------------
This is a simple etch-a-sketch application that allows you to draw pictures in a grid of pixels. The resolution of pixels can be controlled by resetting the grid to your desired size. Two types of paint are available, either additive or absolute. Additive paint allows you to color in different gradients of grey, increasingly more and more white the more you color in a particular pixel. Absolute paint makes every pixel it touches instantly white. This project allowed me to practice basic HTML/CSS design and Javascript DOM interactions.

**Usage**
---------
Just load up the ```index.html``` page and start drawing!

**Future Expansion**
--------------------
This project is pretty much finalized, as there's currently nothing I would like to add to it. In the future, maybe as a full-stack exercise, it would be interesting to allow users to save their drawings somehow and return to them later.
